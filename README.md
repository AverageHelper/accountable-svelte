# Accountable

A Vue app for managing monetary assets. All data is encrypted client-side and stored in a Firebase instance that you control.

Note: DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD. Even if I could retrieve your encrypted data from your own Firestore instance (I can't) I cannot decrypt your data that you encrypted with your own password.

### Alternative Projects

There are many open-source balance keepers out there, but none I've found that I quite like. A few are listed [here](https://opensource.com/life/17/10/personal-finance-tools-linux).

### The Goal

The aim of Accountable is to be cross-platform and portable. Eventually, I plan to have an Android client on the F-droid store, an iOS app on the App Store, and a website as well. The self-host option will always be available to all clients, and I intend for this project to always be open-source.

## Setup

### Prerequesites

This project requires NPM v7 or above. You can check what version you have installed by running `npm -v`:

```sh
$ npm -v
7.20.3
```

### Installation

- Clone the repository
- Set up a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project
- Under "Your apps" select the Web platform and register a Firebase app
- Note your app's `apiKey`, `projectId`, and `authDomain`
- Save these values to a .env file at the root of the project, as shown below:

```sh
# .env
# Vite pulls these in at build time

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY={your API key here}
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET={your storage bucket here}
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN={your auth domain here}
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID={your project ID here}
```

Install dependencies and run!

```sh
$ cd accountable-vue
$ npm install
$ npm run export-version
$ npm start
```

Vite will give your a URL to paste into your browser. It should look something like [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Give that a go, and you're off to the races!
